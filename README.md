# Week 12 Project â€” Translator Verifier

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week we decided on a translator verifier web app and I'm allowed to work on it only Sunday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but Iâ€™m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if Iâ€™m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this wonâ€™t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? ðŸ˜…)

## About the project
Provide a phrase in english and then choose what languages you wanna check the translation from, for each language you choose you need to provide the translated phrase and the app will tell you if it is translated right or wrong, if wrong you get the right translation.
